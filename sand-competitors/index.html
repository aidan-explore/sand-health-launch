    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Professional -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard, moving away from the linear report format. It's structured into four thematic sections: 1) An interactive 'Landscape Map' (a quadrant chart) for a high-level visual comparison. 2) A 'Competitor Deep Dive' section with clickable tabs to explore each company individually. 3) A 'Side-by-Side Comparison' grid to directly compare answers to key questions across all companies. 4) A 'Strategic Insights' section summarizing the key takeaways for Sand Technologies. This structure was chosen to facilitate user-driven exploration and direct comparison, which is more effective for synthesis than a static document. The user can start with a broad overview and drill down into details as needed, making the dense information highly consumable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Landscape Map: Report Info -> Competitor positioning on Market/Business Model axes. Goal -> Organize/Compare. Viz -> Scatter Plot. Interaction -> Hover for tooltips, click to navigate to deep dive. Justification -> Provides an instant, high-level understanding of the competitive arena. Library -> Chart.js. 2. Deep Dive: Report Info -> Detailed company profiles. Goal -> Inform. Presentation -> Tabbed content cards. Interaction -> Click tabs to switch company views. Justification -> Organizes detailed information cleanly, preventing content overload. Method -> Vanilla JS DOM manipulation. 3. Comparison Grid: Report Info -> Answers to the four key questions for each company. Goal -> Compare. Presentation -> Responsive grid. Interaction -> N/A (static comparison). Justification -> Allows for direct, at-a-glance comparison of specific attributes. Method -> Tailwind CSS Grid. 4. Strategic Insights: Report Info -> Recommendations for Sand Tech. Goal -> Inform. Presentation -> Accordion cards. Interaction -> Click to expand/collapse. Justification -> Presents final conclusions in a digestible, interactive format. Method -> Vanilla JS. -->
