## Navigation

The hub uses a tabbed interface that dynamically loads content:

1. **Overview** - High-level summary and quick navigation
2. **RACI Matrix** - Responsibility matrix for all key activities
3. **Team OKRs** - Quarterly objectives and key results
4. **Interaction Model** - How teams work together
5. **Dependency Graph** - Visual team relationships
6. **Quarterly Timeline** - 2025 delivery milestones
7. **Success Metrics** - KPIs and risk indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Modular Architecture
- Content is separated into individual HTML files
- Main page uses JavaScript to dynamically load content
- Each module contains its own styles and scripts
- Easy to maintain and update individual sections

### Content Loading
- Uses `fetch()` API to load modular content
- Content is parsed and injected into the DOM
- Scripts are executed after content loading
- Error handling for missing or corrupted files

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly grid layouts
- Adaptive tab navigation
- Optimized for various screen sizes

## Usage

### For Users
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate between tabs to access different content areas
3. Content loads dynamically as you switch tabs
4. All information is accessible from a single interface

### For Developers
1. Edit individual `.html` files to update specific content
2. Main page automatically loads updated content
3. Add new tabs by creating new content files and updating the main page
4. Styles are scoped to individual modules

### For Content Managers
1. Update team information in `okrs.html`
2. Modify responsibilities in `raci.html`
3. Adjust timelines in `timeline.html`
4. Update metrics in `metrics.html`

## Benefits
